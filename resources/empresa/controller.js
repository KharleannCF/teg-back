Ok, I can help you improve the code in `resources\empresa\controller.js`.

Here are some suggestions:

1. **Consistent Error Handling:** The code currently uses `console.log(err)` for error logging, which is not ideal for production environments. It's better to use a dedicated logging library or a centralized error handling mechanism.
2. **Clearer Response Messages:** The success messages could be more informative. For example, instead of "Empresa creada exitosamente", you could include the created empresa's ID or name.
3. **Avoid Unnecessary `lean()` Calls:** The `lean()` method is used to return plain JavaScript objects instead of Mongoose documents. While it can be useful in some cases, it's not strictly necessary in this code.
4. **Use Async/Await for Better Readability:** The code can be made more readable and easier to understand by using `async/await` instead of nested `then` callbacks.

Here's the updated code:
